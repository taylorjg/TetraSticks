## Description

This project will be another demo program for [DlxLib](https://github.com/taylorjg/DlxLib).
Currently, [DlxLib](https://github.com/taylorjg/DlxLib) does not support secondary columns
as described in Donald E. Knuth's original
[Dancing Links](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047v1.pdf "Dancing Links") paper around pages 17-18 when
he talks about solving puzzles involving 15 of the 16 possible tetra sticks in a 5 x 5 square..
